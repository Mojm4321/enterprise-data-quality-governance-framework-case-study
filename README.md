#  Enterprise Data Quality & Data Governance Framework - Case Study

# Introduction

Many organisations struggle to fully understand and trust their data, particularly as they adapt to the digital age in pursuit of competitive advantage. Progress is often limited by weak data foundations, driven by insufficient focus on data governance and quality at the point of data creation. Data, like money or equipment, requires active management across its entire lifecycle. Without this control, organisations are unable to maximise value and are exposed to financial, operational, regulatory and reputational risk.

This project focuses on the importance of enterprise level data quality and data governance through the design of a data quality framework and executive summary, presented as a case study for EverTrend Retail Group (ETR) a large multi channel retail organisation. The case study demonstrates how data quality can be embedded at source across the full data lifecycle, supported by governance roles, metadata management, master data management (MDM), privacy controls and cloud enablement using AWS and Snowflake.

## Business Context 

EverTrend Retail Group (ETR) operates across physical stores, e-commerce, and mobile platforms. Its rapid growth through mergers and digital expansion has resulted in fragmented and inconsistent data across core systems including Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Shopify and Excel. These challenges have led to poor data quality, analytics bottlenecks, increased regulatory risk and limited ability to scale advanced capabilities such as AI-driven personalisation and dynamic pricing.

## Scope

The framework focuses on enterprise-critical data elements or domains:
- Customer
- Product
- Sales

It prioritises data quality across six dimensions:
- Accuracy
- Timeliness
- Completeness
- Validity
- Consistency
- Uniqueness

## Key Components

- Enterprise data governance operating model
- Data quality framework embedded across the data lifecycle
- Metadata management
- Master Data Management
- Privacy, consent, retention, and compliance controls
- Cloud-based architecture (AWS & Snowflake)
- Maturity model (current vs target state)

## Documents

- Data Quality Framework (Presentation)
- Executive Summary (Word)
